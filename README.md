##game info
*How to Play*: In order to win the game, the player needs to clear all the destoyable bricks (the green ones are undestroyable, but still can be destroyed by missiles). After clearing all the bricks, the player needs to bounce the ball into the slot on the other side in order to continue to next level. This game include 3 levels, the player gets 3 lives in each level.
*Powerups*: Missiles, bigger paddle, smaller paddle, faster ball, slower ball
*Bricks*: Blue: hit once to destroy; Grey: hit twice to destroy; Green: undestroyable (could be destroyed by missile)
*Cheat Keys for Testing*: 
L: Add an additional life

P: Protect the bouncer from falling below the screen
C: Go to next level

*Known Bugs/Crashes*: 
1. When the user gets the second Missile powerup before the previous one launching all the missiles, the missles from previous powerup will be cleared accidentally.
2. Sometimes the ball would bounce off the bricks in unexpected ways. However, it isn't necessarily a bad thing, since it adds a little unpredictability and fun to the game. 
*Extra Feature*: There is a slow sign in the game, when the ball enters the slow sign zone, it will slow down, and will resume to normal speed upon exiting
