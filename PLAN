PLAN FOR BREAKOUT GAME
YANBO FANG

This is a variant of Breakout game that has an air hockey theme. Player will control the paddle horizontally to hit the puck (ball), which will bounce around the screen. To win the game, the player will need to send the puck into the slot on the other end of the table. Bricks will be scattered across the table to block the puck. The player need to use the puck to destroy the blocks and clear the way. There will also be another paddle in front of the other slot. It will move regularly to prevent the puck from getting in the slot. On the other hand, if the puck goes into the player's own slot, the player will lose a life.

I think this variant of Breakout game will be very interesting since it essentially incorporates 2 games: breakout and air hockey.

LEVELS
This game will have at least 3 different levels. The main differences will be:
-Different starting configuration of blocks (more/closer blocks as the level increases)
-The speed of the puck (ball) will increase as the level increases.

BLOCKS
There will be at least 4 different kind of blocks:
-Typical block: cleared after 1 hit
-Tough block: cleared after 2/3 hit
-Undestroyable block: block that can't be cleared
-TNT: if hit by the puck, it will explode and clear the surrounding blocks

POWER-UPS
When the player destroy some blocks, power-ups will drop off; There are good power-ups as well bad ones, the player can differentiate them by their color, eg. green means good, red means bad
Good power-ups:
-Bigger paddle
-Slower puck
-Missle
-Extra pucks
Bad power-ups:
-Smaller paddle
-Faster puck

CHEAT KEYS:
L: Add an additional life.
D: Destroy all destroyable blocks.
P: The puck will not get in player's own slot. Instead it will bounce back.
C: Clear the current level and move to next level.
F: Fulfill the power gauge.

EXTRA FEATURE:
There will be a power gauge that will be filled whenever the puck strikes a block. When the power gauge is fully filled, the player can perform a special move. The player will get 1 missle if he/she presses 1. The player will get 2 extra pucks if he/she presses 2.
I got the idea of power gauge from The King of Fighters. The power gauge in that game is one of my favorite features which I think could also make my game more interesting.
